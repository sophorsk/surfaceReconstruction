compsig.m

This function computes the signature of the space curve.  We use the numerically invariant approximations from Boutinâ€™s paper.

signature3d.m

This file applies an 3d Euclidean transformation to a given curve.  We would like to add some computation of the signature to begin experimenting with congruent curves and their signatures.  This file can serve as a testbed for signature computations.

10/26:  added a symbolic computation of exact values of curvature and torsion for comparison with approximation computations in compsig.m


curvereconstruction2d.m

This is a fancy way of using Delaunay triangulations to order the points in a point cloud that is supposed to represent a sampling of points on a curve.

DataGen.m

This is to generate synthetic data (spherical puzzle pieces) for testing purpose.

compRotation.m
This file contains a method to compute the rotation from one curve to another curve from Matrix Computations. 
The method takes two input: curve1, and curve2. Now it is called in similarityTest. Run the similarityTest.m
